Some things to consider - 

1.In Binary generator used to generate binary stream,a C++ engine is used.
  Compatibility of this engine depends on corresponding versions of C++ & compiler used.

2.If not compatible we can use srand() & rand() functions to generate binary stream.
  (This engine is just used to increase randomness in distribution of numbers.)
